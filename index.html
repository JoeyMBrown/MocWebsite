        We are working on establishing many custom servers for fellow ark

        for a set amount of time to allow subscribers to gain the advantage of
        playing before non-subscribers. This advantaged play time is an

        players online at once. This is better than most offical Ark servers.
        It's important to remember that donating can give you incredible
        advantages and should be considered. Not only does it give players an
        incredible advantage it also helps us keep the servers up and running.
